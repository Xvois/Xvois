I am a firm believer that the internet can be much better than it is at the moment. We have the technology and resources to create a more efficient, informative, and engaging digital world. My passion lies in contributing to this vision by leveraging my skills and interests in physics, mathematics, astronomy, astrophysics, and web development.

## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a university physics student in the UK, deeply fascinated by the mysteries of the universe and the principles that govern it. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in:

- **Physics**: Exploring the fundamental forces and particles that constitute our reality.
- **Mathematics**: The language through which we describe and understand complex phenomena.
- **Astronomy & Astrophysics**: Delving into the cosmos, from our solar system to distant galaxies.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Next.js, Supabase
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git, GitHub, Node.js

## Experience

My project experience spans developing social platforms, educational tools, and utility applications. I've worked with technologies such as NextJS, React, and Supabase to build web applications that are user-friendly and efficient. Some highlights include:

- Developing an online forum for a university community.
- Creating a social platform based on music preferences.
- Building a web-based authentication system.
- Developing various utility tools to enhance user productivity and experience.

## Goals

ðŸŽ¯ **Enhance the Digital Experience**: By combining my scientific knowledge with web development skills, I strive to contribute to a better, more informative, and user-friendly internet.

ðŸ“š **Continuous Learning**: The pursuit of knowledge is endless, and I am committed to lifelong learning and sharing what I learn with others.
